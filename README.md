# Servant

**Servant** is a smart, lightweight system designed to help small teams, students, and startups effortlessly track the third-party services their projects use and manage team members’ roles and access levels. By centralizing project, service, and team management, it ensures that everything stays organized, transparent, and secure—no more lost credentials or forgotten services.

Built with **React**, **Django**, **PostgreSQL**, and **JWT authentication**, Servant also plans to integrate with external password managers via **OAuth 2.0** for enhanced security. Whether you’re monitoring projects, auditing team actions, or generating reports, Servant makes project service management simple, reliable, and efficient.
