# Servant

**Servant** is a smart, lightweight system designed to help small teams, students, and startups effortlessly track the third-party services their projects use and manage team members’ roles and access levels. By centralizing project, service, and team management, it ensures that everything stays organized, transparent, and secure—no more lost credentials or forgotten services.

Built with **React**, **Django**, **PostgreSQL**, and **JWT authentication**, Servant also plans to integrate with external password managers via **OAuth 2.0** for enhanced security. Whether you’re monitoring projects, auditing team actions, or generating reports, Servant makes project service management simple, reliable, and efficient.

Live website (React only): https://servant-gamma.vercel.app/

Note: Do not enter sensitive information on the live React demo, as it stores data in local storage and is not secure. For real projects, please use the full-stack version that will be released in the future.
